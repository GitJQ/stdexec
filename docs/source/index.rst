Welcome to ``stdexec``
======================

``stdexec`` is the reference implementation for `C++26's asynchronous execution framework
<https://eel.is/c++draft/exec>`_,  ``std::execution``. It provides a modern,
composable, and efficient abstraction for asynchronous programming in C++.

Sender/Receiver Abstraction in C++26
====================================

The **sender/receiver abstraction** is a foundational model for asynchronous programming in
modern C++, proposed for standardization in **C++26** (originally targeted for C++23). It aims
to unify and modernize asynchronous workflows across the C++ ecosystem.

ðŸ”§ Motivation
--------------

C++'s legacy async mechanisms â€” ``std::async``, futures, coroutines â€” have several limitations:

- Inflexible and hard to compose.

- Inefficient or heap-heavy.

- Difficult to customize or extend.

- Incompatible across libraries (e.g., Boost, Folly).

The sender/receiver abstraction offers:

- Composable async operations.

- Customizable schedulers and execution strategies.

- Clean cancellation handling.

- Coroutine integration.

- Zero-cost abstractions.

ðŸ§± Core Concepts
----------------

1. Scheduler
^^^^^^^^^^^^

A **scheduler** is an object that provides a way to schedule work. They are lightweight
handles to what is often a heavy-weight and immovable **execution context**. Execution
contexts are where work actually happens, and they can be anything that can execute code.
Examples of execution contexts:

- Thread pools.
- Event loops.
- GPUs.
- An I/O subsystem.
- Any other execution model.

.. code-block:: cpp

    auto sched = exec::get_parallel_scheduler();   // Obtain the default system scheduler
    auto sndr  = stdexec::schedule(sched);         // Create a sender from the scheduler

The sender you get back from ``stdexec::schedule`` is a factory for operations that,
when started, will immediately call ``set_value()`` on the receiver the operation was
constructed with. And crucially, it does so from the context of the scheduler. Work
is executed on a context by chaining continuations to one of these senders, and passing
it to one of the algorithms that starts work, like ``stdexec::sync_wait``.

2. Sender
^^^^^^^^^

A **sender** is an object that describes an asynchronous computation that may happen
later. It can do nothing on its own, but when connected to a receiver, it returns an
**operation state** that can start the work described by the sender.

``stdexec`` provides a set of generic **sender algorithms** that can be used to chain
operations together. There are also algorithms, like ``stdexec::sync_wait``, that can
be used to launch the sender. The sender algorithms take care of connecting the sender
to a receiver and managing the lifetime the operation state.

- Produces values (or errors) asynchronously.

- Can be requested to stop early.

- Supports composition.

- Is lazy (does nothing until connected and started).

.. code-block:: cpp

    auto sndr = stdexec::just(42);                    // Sender that yields 42 immediately
    auto [result] = stdexec::sync_wait(sndr).value(); // Start the work & wait for the result
    assert(result.value() == 42);

3. Receiver
^^^^^^^^^^^

A **receiver** is an object that consumes the result of a sender. It defines three
member functions that handle completion:

- ``.set_value(args...)``: Called on success.

- ``.set_error(err)``: Called on error.

- ``.set_stopped()``: Called if the operation is canceled.

.. code-block:: cpp

    struct MyReceiver {
      using receiver_concept = stdexec::receiver_t;

      void set_value(int v) noexcept                { /* success      */ }
      void set_error(std::exception_ptr e) noexcept { /* error        */ }
      void set_stopped() noexcept                   { /* cancellation */ }
    };

As a user, you typically won't deal with receivers directly.
They are an implementation detail of sender algorithms.

4. Operation State
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Connecting a sender to a receiver yields an **operation state**, which:

- Represents the in-progress computation.

- Is started explicitly via ``.start()``.

.. code-block:: cpp

    auto op = stdexec::connect(sndr, MyReceiver{}); // Connect sender to receiver
    stdexec::start(op);                             // Start the operation

Operation states are immovable, and once started, they must be kept alive until the
operation completes. As a user though, you typically will not manage them directly.
They are handled by the sender algorithms.

5. Environments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Environments are a key concept in the sender/receiver model. An **environment** is an
unordered collection of key/value pairs, queryable at runtime via tag types. Every
receiver has a (possibly empty) environment that can be obtained by passing the receiver
to ``stdexec::get_env()``.

Environments provide a way to pass contextual information like stop tokens, allocators, or
schedulers to asynchronous operations. That information is then used by the operation to
customize its behavior.

ðŸ§® Composition via Algorithms
-----------------------------

One benefit of the lazy evaluation of senders is that it makes it possible to create
reusable algorithms that can be composed together. ``stdexec`` provides a rich set of
algorithms that can be used to build complex asynchronous workflows.

A **sender factory algorithm** creates a sender that can be used to start an operation.
Below are some of the key sender factory algorithms provided by ``stdexec``:

.. list-table:: Sender Factory Algorithms

  * - **CPO**
    - **Description**
  * - ``stdexec::schedule``
    - Obtains a sender from a scheduler.
  * - ``stdexec::just``
    - Creates a sender that will immediately complete with a set of values.
  * - ``stdexec::read_env``
    - Reads a value from the receiver's environment and completes with it.

A **sender adaptor algorithm** takes an existing sender (or several senders) and
transforms it into a new sender with additional behavior. Below are some key sender
adaptor algorithms. Check the :ref:`Reference` section for additional algorithms.

.. list-table:: Sender Adaptor Algorithms
  :class: tight-table

  * - **CPO**
    - **Description**
  * - ``stdexec::then``
    - Applies a function to the value from a sender.
  * - ``stdexec::starts_on``
    - Executes an async operation on the specified scheduler.
  * - ``stdexec::continues_on``
    - Executes an async operation on the current scheduler and then transfers
      execution to the specified scheduler.
  * - ``stdexec::on``
    - Executes an async operation on a different scheduler and then transitions
      back to the original scheduler.
  * - ``stdexec::when_all``
    - Combines multiple senders, making it possible to execute them in parallel.
  * - ``stdexec::let_value``
    - Executes an async operation dynamically based on the results of a specified
      sender.
  * - ``stdexec::write_env``
    - Writes a value to the receiver's environment, allowing it to be used by
      child operations.

A **sender consumer algorithm** takes a sender connects it to a receiver and starts the
resulting operation. Here are some key sender consumer algorithms:

.. list-table:: Sender Consumer Algorithms

  * - **CPO**
    - **Description**
  * - ``stdexec::sync_wait``
    - Blocks the calling thread until the sender completes and returns the result.
  * - ``stdexec::start_detached``
    - Starts the operation without waiting for it to complete.

Sender algorithms are defined in terms of **core customization points**. Below are the
core customization points that define how senders and receivers interact:

.. list-table:: Core customization points

  * - **CPO**
    - **Description**
  * - ``stdexec::connect``
    - Connects a sender to a receiver resulting in an operation state.
  * - ``stdexec::start``
    - Starts the operation.
  * - ``stdexec::set_value``
    - Called by the operation state to deliver a value to the receiver.
  * - ``stdexec::set_error``
    - Called by the operation state to deliver an error to the receiver.
  * - ``stdexec::set_stopped``
    - Called by the operation state to indicate that the operation was stopped.
  * - ``stdexec::get_env``
    - Retrieves the environment from a receiver.

Here is an example of using sender algorithms to create a simple async pipeline:

.. code-block:: cpp

                    // Create a sender that produces a value:
    auto pipeline = stdexec::just(42)
                    // Transform the value using `then` on the specified scheduler:
                  | stdexec::on(some_scheduler, stdexec::then([](int i) { return i * 2; }))
                    // Further transform the value using `then` on the starting scheduler:
                  | stdexec::then([](int i) { return i + 1; });
                    // Finally, wait for the result:
    auto [result] = stdexec::sync_wait(std::move(pipeline)).value();


ðŸ”„ Coroutine Integration
------------------------

Senders can be ``co_await``-ed in coroutines if they model ``awaitable_sender``. Any sender
that can complete successfully in exactly one way is an awaitable sender.

.. code-block:: cpp

    auto my_task() -> exec::task<int> {
      int x = co_await some_sender();
      co_return x + 1;
    }

If a sender that is being ``co_await``-ed completes with an error, the coroutine will
throw an exception. If it completes with a stop, the coroutine will be canceled. That is,
the coroutine will never be resumed; rather, it and its calling coroutines will be
destroyed.

In addition, all awaitable types can be used as senders, allowing them to be composed with
sender algorithms.

This allows ergonomic, coroutine-based async programming with sender semantics under the
hood.

ðŸš¦ Standardization Status (as of 2025)
--------------------------------------

- The core sender/receiver model has been accepted into the C++ standard for C++26.

- Additional facilities have also been accepted such as

  * a system scheduler,
  * a sender-aware coroutine task type,
  * an async scope for spawning tasks dynamically.

- Interop with networking is being explored for C++29.

- Widely prototyped and tested in libraries and production settings.

ðŸš€ Benefits
-----------

- âœ… Zero-cost abstractions: No heap allocations or runtime overhead.

- âœ… Composable: Express async pipelines clearly.

- âœ… Customizable: Plug in your own schedulers, tokens, adapters.

- âœ… Coroutine-friendly: Clean ``co_await`` support.

ðŸ”š Summary
-----------

The sender/receiver abstraction:
